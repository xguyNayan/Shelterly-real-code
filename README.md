🔹 Purpose of This Repository

✔ Proof of Original Authorship

To document the complete source code I created for the Shelterly platform.

✔ Reference for DMCA Review

This is the code referenced under the “original copyrighted work” section of my DMCA takedown notice submitted to Vercel.

✔ Evidence of Unauthorized Use

The platform currently deployed at:

contains and uses my copyrighted code, UI, logic, and architecture without authorization after the termination of the agreement with the operators.

🔹 Agreement & Termination Summary (For DMCA Reviewers)

I was contractually required to maintain Contributor access to the GitHub repository.

My access was downgraded without permission, preventing me from accessing or updating my own authored code.

Live deployment changes were made without the required mutual approval, violating contractual terms.

They misrepresented their business status in the agreement.

They failed to provide required developer credits.

Due to repeated breaches, I issued a formal termination on 15 November 2025.

All usage rights to my authored code automatically reverted to me upon termination.

Despite this, the deployment remained active without authorization, resulting in copyright infringement.
